Usage: ./parser.py SRC_FILE
Language semantics: 

All symbols must be separated by spaces.
Valid symbols are:
<< VAR (write integers to stdout)
>> VAR (read integers from stdin)
< VAR (write ascii to stdout)
> VAR (read ascii from stdin)
VAR ++ (increment)
VAR = 0 (declare variable and/or assign 0)
VAR = OTHERVAR (declare variable and/or assign OTHERVAR to it)
loop VAR (execute the following block VAR times. Blocks are denoted python-style using indentation.)
# Comments start with # .
For cli-mode (reading from '-'), use 'exit' to terminate the program and begin reading input.
